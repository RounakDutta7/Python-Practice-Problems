# Python Practice Problems
This project includes python program solutions for beginners.

### Problem 1
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

### Problem 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Extras:
1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

### Problem 3
Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:
1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
2. Write this in one line of Python.
3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

### Problem 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

### Problem 4
Take two lists, and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
1. Randomly generate two lists to test this.
2. Write this in one line of Python.
