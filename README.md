# H3 Problem 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Extras:
1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

# H3 Problem 3
Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:
1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
2. Write this in one line of Python.
3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.
