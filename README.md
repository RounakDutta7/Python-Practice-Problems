# Python Practice Problems
This project includes python programming problems and solutions. Try to solve yourself before opening the solutions. I'll upload one or more problem everyday. So, be ready.

If you find any error in the codes below, feel free to fork and update, or you can contact me at - rounak.dutta.cs@gmail.com

## Level Description
- Level 1:	Beginner means someone who has just gone through an introductory Python course. He can solve some problems with 1 or 2 Python classes or functions. Normally, the answers could directly be found in the textbooks.

- Level 2:	Intermediate means someone who has just learned Python, but already has a relatively strong programming background from before. He should be able to solve problems which may involve 3 or 3 Python classes or functions. The answers cannot be directly be found in the textbooks.

- Level 3:	Advanced. He should use Python to solve more complex problem using more rich libraries functions and data structures and algorithms. He is supposed to solve the problem using several Python standard packages and advanced techniques.

# Happy Coding!


### Problem 1 (Level 1)
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

### Problem 2 (Level 1)
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Extras:
1. If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2. Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

### Problem 3 (Level 1)
Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:
1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
2. Write this in one line of Python.
3. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

### Problem 4 (Level 1)
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

### Problem 5 (Level 1)
Take two lists, and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
1. Randomly generate two lists to test this.
2. Write this in one line of Python.

### Problem 6 (Level 1)
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

[Solution](solutions/prac6.py)

---

### Problem 7 (Level 1)
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

### Problem 8 (Level 1)
Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

**Hint:**
Ask for player plays (using input), compare them.
Print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.

**Remember the rules:**

rock beats scissors
scissors beats paper
paper beats rock
